\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sec:con}

In this paper, we present both the pre-processing and on-the-fly techniques to solve the synthesis problem of \ltl over finite traces. Comparing to existing methods, our approach allows us to perform the synthesis by possibly just generating partially the \dfa w.r.t. the input \ltlf formula. The experiment results show that, (1) the pre-processing technique can bring an exponential-better performance than the classical synthesis approach; (2) our on-the-fly synthesis approach complements the extant one by speeding up the synthesis of 50 instances in the benchmarks.
